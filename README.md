# Collection of personal dotfiles, always WIP

Use linkdots.sh to link all (or specified) dotfiles to your home directory.

If you for some reason want my neovim config you can install it instantly using

```sh
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PaxPlay/dotfiles/refs/heads/master/install-nvim-config.sh | bash
```
